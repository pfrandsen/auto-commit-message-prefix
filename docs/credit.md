This extension was created as a learning experience for creating a Visual Studio Code extension.
For this I looked at the samples provided by [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/). I used Yeoman to generate the skeleton project.

The main inspiration for the code came from Michael Currin's [auto-commit-msg](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/auto-commit-msg) extension.

After I developed the extension I came across Samuel Meyers [srmeyers/git-prefix](https://github.com/srmeyers/git-prefix) extension that pretty much does the same thing.
